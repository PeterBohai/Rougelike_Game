ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION

IMPORTANT: You must properly attribute me in order to use my music and images legally:

You must attribute me in the actual video, game, interactive novel, etc.…not merely on the Youtube or game info page.

FOR MUSIC:

If you are using only my music and not that of another artist(s) then your credits screen in your video or game needs to say:

Music by Eric Matyas

www.soundimage.org

If you are using my music as well as those of another artist(s) then you need to identify which tracks (and/or sound effects) are mine and credit me, for example:

“Invasion of the Giant Disco Ants”

“Too Quiet”

“Mayhem”
